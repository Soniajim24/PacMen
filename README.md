# PacMen
## Description
This webpage creates a new PacMan every time the "Add PacMan" button is clicked on. 
By clicking on the button "Start Game" the PacMen start moving at different speeds.

## How to run it

The [PacMen_index](https://github.com/Soniajim24/PacMen/blob/main/PacMen_index.html) file must be opened in the browser.

First, click on the button "Add PacMan", then click on the button "Start Game".

The code can be found in the [pacmen.js](https://github.com/Soniajim24/PacMen/blob/main/pacmen.js) file.

## Roadmap of future improvements
Add the other 3 images in the movement of the PacMen, so that they open and close their mouth and they turn around when they hit the edge of the screen.
